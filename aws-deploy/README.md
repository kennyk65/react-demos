# Deploy React on AWS

This project provides a complete example of how to deploy a React based application on AWS.  It consists of three main elements:

1.  The React application
2.  A CloudFormation template to build out the AWS infrastructure (S3 bucket for React build code, API Gateway and Lambda for backend APIs, CloudFront distribution)
3.  Github actions for building and deploying the React app to S3.
